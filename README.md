# starting_kit_epiclock1.0



Hi Dears,

The goal of the data challenge is to propose you to resolve a use case in data analysis, which is usually taken from real scientific projects and real data (in a simplified form). You will be given with some omics data and a goal (challenge). You are then free to use any approach and technique to succeed. Depending on the question, sometimes it would be more appropriate to use classical statistical methods, sometimes skills in machine learning may be helpful.

This challenge aims to use statistical or machine learning models (e.g. linear models, support vector machines) to predict the chronological age of patients using their blood DNA methylation profil.

The challenge provides 2 data.frames (data_test and data_train, see below) corresponding to blood samples described by age, sex DNA methylation values. The goal of this challenge is to predict the age of patients. The methylation values are beta value (0<=beta<=1).

We hope you will enjoy the challenge.
